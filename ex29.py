## Study Drills ##
# 1. What do you think the "if" does to the code under it?
# 1A. if the value is true it will trigger the funtion underneath it. 
# 2. Why Does the code under the "if" need to be indented four spaces?
# 2A. To create a block. Local vs Global?
# 3. What happens if it isnt indented?  
# 3A. IndentationError
# 4. Can you put other boolean expressions from exercise 27 in the if-statement?
# 4A. Yes. See extra credit below
# 5. What happens if you change the initial variables for People, Cats, and dogs?
# 5A. A different If statement is triggered

#Extra Credit
if people == dogs or people != cats:
	print "People are dogs"

if people == dogs and cats != people:
