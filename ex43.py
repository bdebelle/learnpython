# Returning Next Room?
# Returning the next room as a string assigns this returned value to next_scene_name. We then call the next_scene function and give it the 
# parameter of next_scene_name. The next_scene function looks at scenes dictionary with the next_scene_name as a key and gets the
# corresponding value. The corresponding value is a new instance of the next room, So we create a mew instance of the next room and then 
# call the enter funtion on that room.
